## 🚀 How to Run (Zero Setup Required)

I've included "Launchers" that handle everything for you. They will automatically install dependencies (FFmpeg, Python libraries) if they are missing.

### 🍎 Users on Mac
1. Double-click the file named **`start_mac.command`**.
2. A terminal window will open briefly and then close.
3. Your browser will automatically open the app at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 🪟 Users on Windows
1. Double-click the file named **`start_windows.bat`**.
2. A command prompt will open and execute in the background.
3. Your browser will automatically open the app.
